/**
 * FAT and file functions.
 *
 * Some notes about the file API
 *
 * 1. The API can block the current thread for a number of reasons. Usually it
 * boils to two cases: file objects can only have one active operation on it at
 * one time. Second the cart layer only supports one read/write operation at one
 * time.
 *
 * 2. Using blocking CPU transfer is always interrupable. Higher priority
 * threads can preempt the read thread. Mount the FS with dma number -1 and
 * only use the blocking file read function to read data. This could be useful
 * in implementing file accesses that should be done in a background thread. But
 * you also always have the option to split accesses into many smaller parts to
 * get concurrency. I guess the only reason for CPU only cart IO is that you
 * need to allocate DMA channel for more important work.
 *
 * 3. Using DMA for file transfers are *not* quarantied to use DMA unless a
 * bunch of alignment constraints are met. See cart.h
 *
 * 4. Asynchronicity is only really possible using DMA transfers and the CPU
 * doing work from cache and TCM memory only, since DMA work blocks the CPU from
 * the memory bus. But thread switching will most likely block if main memory
 * can't be accessed, so getting that to work is probably tricky. And probably
 * of limited use.
 *
 * 5. The async option only make sense in conjunction with DMA transfers.
 *
 * Conclusion: Async file operation is almost useless as a feature IMHO.
 * Blocking DMA transfers might be useful, from a performance perspective, but
 * require some work and planning to get max performance. Since Flash carts have
 * custom (cart) IO implementations it will be basically imposible to tell in
 * the general case if DMA and async operation is even used at all. Add to this
 * the fact that SD cards also differ wildly in IO performance. Designing your
 * program to be very conservative regarding IO performance is probably a good
 * idea.
 *
 * NOTE: To see how file loading is performed by the SDK at a lower level see
 * cart.h
